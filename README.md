# arctic-lab

Roguelike game written in Python using the libtcod libraries.  Built off of the Roguebasin Python libtcod tutorial.

Loosely based on John Carpenter's "The Thing" your goal is to try and discover which scientist or other creature is actually an alien monster disguising itself, and kill it before it kills you!
